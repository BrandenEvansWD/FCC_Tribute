            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Steve Yzerman was born May 9, 1965 in Cranbook, British Columbia, Canada. Yzerman quickly became a star
                of the Detroit Redwings, an is revered as one of the all-time greats to play the sport of Ice Hockey.
                Considered one of the most popular athletes in Detroit sports history; fans often referred to him as
                “Stevie Wonder” and “The Captain.”</p>

            <p>Yzerman was able to pile up quite a collection of awards during his career, including the Lester B.
                Pearson award, the Conn Smythe Trophy, the Selke Trophy, and the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, not to
                mention three Stanley Cup Championships. In 2008, Steve Yzerman was inducted into the Hockey Hall of
                Fame alongside Brett Hull and Luc Robitaille. In 2017, Yzerman was named one of the top “100 Greatest
                NHL Players” in history.</p>

            <p>His playing career extended from 1983 - 2006 before deciding to “hang up the skates” and retiring. To
                the admiration of all Detroit Redwing fans, Yzerman would stay on the team in a management roll, and
                helped to earn another Stanley Cup for his team in 2008 before his departure elsewhere in 2010.</p>

            <h2>Career</h2>
            <h3>Early Career</h3>
            <p>During the 1983 NHL Entry Draft, the Red Wings were planning on using their 4th overall pick on Pat
                Lafontaine, who was a Michigan native and played junior hockey in the Detroit area. After Lafontaine was
                selected 3rd overall by the New York Islanders, they settled with the next highest rated prospect; Steve
                Yzerman. He finished his rookie season with 39 goals and 87 points, nearly earning himself the “Rookie
                of the Year.” </p>

            <p>To finish off his astonishing rookie season, Yzerman was given the honor of participating in the NHL
                All-Star Game at 18-years-old, which would come to set a record for 27 years to come.</p>

            <h3>Pro Career</h3>
            <p>During the 1986-87 season, the former Redwings captain, Danny Gare, left the team. With an obvious whole
                to fill, Redwings head coach, Jacques Demers announced Steve Yzerman would become the next captain of
                the team, making him the youngest in team history to do so.</p>

            <p>The following season, Yzerman went on to score a then, career high 50 goals. During the game, he suffered
                a knee injury, causing him to miss the rest of the regular season. The team would go on without him to
                win its first Division Title in 23 years. Again, the following 1988-89 season, Yzerman would go on to
                score 65 goals, and tallied 90 assists; finishing third behind Mario Lemieux and Wayne Gretzky and was
                voted as the MVP by the league.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>In 1993, the Detroit Redwings hired head coach Scotty Bowman, known for a stern defensive coaching style
                that didn’t mesh with Yzerman’s offensive mindset. Relations soured between the two, and a trade was
                considered to the Ottawa Senators. They eventually worked through the clashing mindsets and Yzerman led
                the team to its first playoff appearance since 1966.</p>

            <p>Detroit would later go out to win their first Stanley Cup in 1997 after falling short for the last 42
                years.</p>
            <h3>Management Career</h3>
            <p>During September of 2006, Yzerman was named team vice-president and alternate governor of the Detroit
                Redwings. Although happy to be with the team he played on for his entire career, he wanted to run his
                own team. After current general manager, Ken Holland and assistant Jim Bill were given contract
                extensions, Yzerman knew he would have to look elsewhere for his desired management position</p>

            <p>After learning of his interest to manage a team, both the Minnesota Wild and Tampa Bay Lightening had
                offered him the reigns. On May 25th, 2010, Yzerman would be named the vice-president and General Manager
                of the Tampa Bay Lightening. Through some well thought out trades before and during his first season, he
                took a team that didn’t make the playoffs the year prior, to making it to the Eastern Conference Final.
            </p>

            <p>Although he never won a Stanley Cup with Tampa Bay, he did however put all of the pieces together for a
                contending team, who would later go on to win a Stanley Cup soon after Yzerman’s departure. In April of
                2019, Redwings fans rejoiced with the announcement of the homecoming of “The Captain” to become the new
                General Manager of the Detroit Redwings Franchise.</p>
